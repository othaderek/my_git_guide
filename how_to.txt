### --- HOW TO --- ###

Objective: As a reminder to me and my forgetful ass, here are some of the basics of using git and github

1. Create a repository.
	a.) go to github and navigate to your repositories, create new
	and copy the link to that repo.
	b. In terminal, navigate to directory you wish to save repo in
	type: git clone {link to your repo}

2. Git add/push/commit
	a.) After adding files and directories to repo type: git status
	then add any changes by typing "git add ." or "git add {file name}"
	b.) Then type "git commit -m "add your message about your commit here"" Note: the -m part of the commit is important because it helos you keep track of your progress and also leaves notes to memebers of your team about changes that were made.
	c.) After all of this type "git push origin master"
